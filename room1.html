    value="WELCOM.  My name is Megan, and I am a student of Instinctive Meditation.  The best way for me to describe Instinctive Meditation, is that it is a style of meditation for people who hate meditation.  It’s actually a style of meditation for everyone, but especially people who don’t like meditation or feel like they can’t do meditation right.  I was drawn to it because before I discovered instinctive meditation, meditation was something that I wanted to do, something that I knew I should so, but something that I honestly did not enjoy.  I wanted to wake up every day at 5am and meditate because I knew I should, I knew it would be my best self if I did it, because we all know the benefits of meditation.  But my back would start hurting pretty early on, and then I would be thinking about my to-do list, and I felt like I was doing it wrong.  I was trained to calm my body and still my mind, keep coming back to my breath, but my mind would be racing, a million thoughts per second, and my body would be buzzing, and then I would feel an itch, and then my knees would hurt or my hips would ache, and I would feel bad about myself and my “monkey mind.”  Or I wouldn’t do it and then I would feel bad about myself for not doing it.  Either way, I left feeling like I was doing it wrong or I was wrong for not doing it.  Then I discovered instinctive meditation and everything changed. "
