# Be Love Lobby V1

Welcome to **belove-lobby-v1**, the central hub of the Be Love XR experience — a floating, spherical sanctuary where visitors can begin their journey.

This immersive A-Frame space is designed as a peaceful, sacred lobby with soft colors, ambient sound, and three glowing portals that guide users to other rooms in the Be Love platform.

## 🌐 Features

- Inverted **spherical environment** (using `side: back`) for a floating, globe-like feel
- Three **animated portal circles** leading to other rooms (room1, room2, room3)
- **Autoplay ambient sound** to create a meditative, welcoming atmosphere
- Clean, minimalist layout using soft `#d6ecf5` blue and white tones

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Add your custom audio file to the `assets/` folder (e.g., `lobby-sound.mp3`).
3. Replace `room1.html`, `room2.html`, and `room3.html` links with your actual scene files.
4. Upload to GitHub.
5. Deploy via [Netlify](https://netlify.com) or another static site host.

## ✨ Design Intent

This space is part of the **Be Love Peace Platform**, a healing-centered virtual sanctuary rooted in mindfulness, sacred design, and soulful presence.

## 🙏 Credits

Created with ❤️ by Megan, with design inspiration from instinctive meditation, watercolor skies, and the call to walk each other home.
